# Inclinometer
Its a working model to measure height using adrunino, servos and MATLAB
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Measuring height of an object using trigonometry is one of the basic applications of mathematical modelling. But it's so crucial that almost every electronic device we see today rely on trigonometric formulas for the measurement. And height is an important feature of any living or non-living being which can be used to describe its nature. For instance, scientists studying a forest ecosystem over a long period of time may record measurements of trees for a number of variables, including each tree's diameter at breast height, height of the lowest living branch, canopy cover, etc. One aspect of a tree's growth that can be hard to measure is tree height. Forest researchers sometimes use a piece of equipment consisting of telescoping components, which are extended until the tip reaches the same height as the tree top (this requires a second researcher standing at a distance from the tree to determine when the tip is at the correct height). This method can be cumbersome, as the equipment is bulky and the measurements require two people. 
It is necessary because the measurement of tree growth in a forest over time provides important information about the dynamics of that ecosystem. Growth rates can reflect, among other things, differing availability of water, carbohydrates, or nutrients in different sites or from season to season or year to year. 
Therefore, the project aims at creating an electronic model that can be used to approximate the height of an object in a visible range.

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>
We tested the device to measure heights of some of the basic instruments which are recorded in table 1. We measured the heights of three different objects of variable height to demonstrate the methodology and workability of the instrument built. 
We first measured the height of a 'Shoe Rack' which was 135 cm in height measured using a centimeter scale. After calculating the angles alpha and beta and the height (h1) we got the approximate height (h1 +h2) equal to 141.0495 cm. The deviation from actual height was around 6.95 cm more than the actual height.
Second object we used is a wall of height 300 cm. The measured height using the instrument was 296.0658 cm with only 3.9342 cm less than the actual height of the wall.
The third object we used is a 'Cupboard' which was of 200 cm height. The measured height was 196.4411 cm and the error in height was 3.5589 less than the actual height.
On an average the difference between actual and predicted height error was around 4.53 cm.
